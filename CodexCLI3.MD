Read @prompt6.md and implement the next step.

thinking
**Evaluating implementation steps**

I need to revisit prompt6.md to check for any additional tasks we may have misse
d after implementing some items. The document has two sections: general instruct
ions and specific objectives like adding agents and the next step with enqueue/r
esume helpers. We've already added the resume_run feature but might have overloo
ked the enqueue_resume helper. There's a suggestion in the prompt to implement a
 specific method for job queuing that we should consider next, possibly alongsid
e tests or demonstrations.**Modifying acceptance criteria**

I need to adjust the acceptance criteria to include a demo block, which I alread
y did. When the user mentions "implement next step," they're likely referring to
 finalizing the interplay. Our current critic route chooses "turnitin" based on
the policy, while their previous acceptance wanted the "turnitin_pause" route. I
 need to integrate the "resume_run" service into the API and consider placing it
 in the runtime utilities. Additionally, I'll ensure the core/graph.py correctly
 handles the "turnitin_pause" route and checks its status appropriately.**Updati
ng harness for pause/resume**

I need to consider updating the harness to simulate pause and resume functionali
ty. Adding a helper to run the handoff path could be beneficial, and maybe I can
 include demonstration code in the documentation. However, the request emphasize
s code modifications. I'll create a smoke helper in the evaluation harness to ru
n until a pause, then simulate a webhook update. The challenge is that the webho
ok requires the cycle ID, which we didn't log properly in the state. We need to
ensure callers can access the cycle ID, possibly by logging it after insertion.*
*Fixing cycle ID retrieval**

I realized we didn't capture the last inserted ID, which we can get in Postgres
by using "RETURNING id" in our SQL statement. We were using a basic SQL method,
but this adjustment helps retrieve the ID right after insertion. For SQLite, it
may not work the same way, though Alembic created the table with a compatible au
to-increment setting. I'll add functionality to fetch the cycle ID and update th
e coordinator accordingly. It might also be important to consider extending the
state to include cycle_id, along with notes or tasks for better tracking.**Imple
menting changes for resume planning**

I don't think we need to log everything to episodic content. For resume planning
, the webhook can pass along the cycle_id, and returning it via the API might be
 possible. However, there's no API endpoint to start the Turnitin run. The accep
tance specifically wants a demo code block rather than full integration. I'll up
date the critic to route properly based on 'target_similarity' and add the resum
e_run function in the runtime module. Additionally, I’ll create a function for s
imulating the Turnitin flow and implement the necessary changes in the API and c
oordinator to ensure we're fetching and logging the cycle ID.

codex
I read prompt6.md and implemented the next step: a robust HITL Turnitin pause/re
sume path with coordinator node, API webhook, and a proper resume utility.

**Coordinator Node**
- backend/src/autonomy_v2/agents/turnitin_coordinator.py
  - handoff(state):
    - Logs episodic “turnitin_handoff_start” and “turnitin_handoff_complete”.
    - Creates a minimal Workbench assignment + draft artifact via existing repos
:
      - WorkbenchAssignmentRepository.create(...)
      - WorkbenchArtifactRepository.create(...)
    - Inserts a row in autonomy_turnitin_cycles with status “awaiting_report” an
d target_similarity from TaskSpec or config’s `turnitin_target_default`.
    - Fetches the newly created cycle_id and appends it to episodic content.
    - Sets state.route = "turnitin_pause" and returns.

**Graph Routing**
- backend/src/autonomy_v2/core/graph.py
  - Adds a “turnitin” node executing the coordinator handoff.
  - Extends routing to recognize “turnitin” and treat “turnitin_pause” as a paus
e (graph ends while preserving state.route).

- backend/src/autonomy_v2/agents/critic.py
  - If sources exist:
  - No sources → route “plan”.

**Resume Utilities**
- backend/src/autonomy_v2/runtime/resume.py
  - resume_run(run_id, route="act"): Loads last checkpoint via SQL checkpointer,
 sets route, re-invokes the graph.
  - enqueue_resume(run_id, route="act"): Placeholder for a future job queue; cur
rently calls resume_run directly.

**API Webhook**
- backend/src/api/autonomy_v2.py
  - POST /v2/turnitin/{run_id}/report
    - Accepts {cycle_id, report_url, observed_similarity, meta?}
    - Updates the autonomy_turnitin_cycles row to report_ready with observed_sim
ilarity and report_url.
    - Logs an episodic event “turnitin_report_ready” and resumes the run via res
ume_run(run_id, route="act").
  - Uses runtime.resume.resume_run and DB manager; returns {"status": "resumed",
 "route": ...}.

**Harness Demo**
- backend/src/autonomy_v2/evaluation/harness.py
  - demo_turnitin_pause_resume():
    - Starts a run with target_similarity to trigger handoff.
    - Prints paused route, extracts cycle_id from episodic logs, simulates setti
ng report_ready in DB, and calls resume_run to finish.

Commands
- Validate imports:
  - python -m compileall backend/src
- Demo HITL flow in REPL:
  - from backend.src.autonomy_v2.evaluation.harness import demo_turnitin_pause_r
esume
  - out = demo_turnitin_pause_resume()
  - print("Final route:", out.route)

Notes
- No direct Turnitin API calls — humans handle the upload via Workbench, and the
 webhook resumes the run.
- The coordinator stores the cycle_id in the episodic log so the webhook demo ca
n reference it.
- A future step can add a real job queue for resume; for now it’s synchronous.

now, next is to implement the prompt in the updated @prompt7.md

I implemented prompt7.md by adding a minimal, Postgres-backed job queue and a si
mple, resilient worker loop that advances Autonomy V2 runs with per-user concurr
ency and proper pause/resume handling.

**Queue Helpers**
- backend/src/autonomy_v2/runtime/queue.py
  - enqueue(run_id, user_id, journey, priority=5, payload=None) → inserts into a
utonomy_job_queue, returns job id.
  - enqueue_resume(run_id) → inserts a resume job with payload {"route":"act"} a
nd priority 4.

**Worker**
- backend/src/workers/autonomy_v2_worker.py
  - main():
    - Claims one job using SELECT … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED on autonomy_job_queue
 where state='queued' and scheduled_at <= now(), ordered by priority/scheduled_a
t.
    - Per-user concurrency: checks current running count for job.user_id against
 settings.V2_JOB_CONCURRENCY_PER_USER; skips if at limit.
    - Marks job running with locked_by/locked_at.
    - Loads last checkpoint and runs via resume_run(run_id, route=payload.route
    - Transitions:
      - route == "turnitin_pause" → job state "waiting_human".
      - route in {"end","END"} → job state "done".
    - On exceptions → attempts++, exponential backoff (capped), requeue to queue
  - Start the worker locally:
    - python -m backend.src.workers.autonomy_v2_worker

**API Webhook Update**

Compile check: python -m compileall backend/src passed.

2) Enqueue a new run:
- from backend.src.autonomy_v2.runtime.queue import enqueue
- It writes episodic events “job_claimed”, then either “job_done” or “job_waitin
g_human” depending on whether critic requests Turnitin.
4) Simulate Turnitin webhook:
- POST /api/v2/turnitin/run-123/report with {"cycle_id": <from episodic logs>, "
report_url":"https://example.com/report.pdf", "observed_similarity":0.08}
- The route enqueues a resume job; the worker will pick it up and finish the run
.
5) Inspect episodic logs:
- from backend.src.autonomy_v2.memory.episodic_repo import EpisodicRepo
- events = await EpisodicRepo(run_id="run-123").list()
- Verify events include job transitions and (if applicable) pause/resume around
Turnitin.

If you’d like, I can add small CLI commands to enqueue debug jobs and inspect th
e queue, or wire budget counters to stop runs cleanly when thresholds are exceed
ed.

now, next is to implement the prompt in the updated @prompt8.md

thinking
**Executing file instructions**

I need to open prompt8.md and implement the necessary changes. I have to stick t
o the constraints specified in the developer's instructions, like using the `app
ly_patch` tool to edit the files with minimal diffs. It's interesting that the p
lanning tool is optional, but I think I can proceed directly. So, let’s focus on
 reading prompt8.md and make sure I’m following everything carefully!

⚙︎ Working
  L 📖 prompt8.md

thinking
I see that we've already modified the episodic_repo to include append and list m
ethods. Now, the prompt is asking for a write_event function and a list_events f
unction, which means I might need to wrap the existing methods to accommodate th
is new structure. Then there's the vector repo, which currently just returns emp
ty data. I need to implement it using the services from embedding_service.py and
 vector_storage.py, so I should look into those services next!

⚙︎ Working
  L 📖 embedding_service.py
    📖 vector_storage.py

thinking
**Considering vector storage options**

I’m examining the vector storage and realizing it doesn’t have a straightforward
 method for chunk upsert by URL. We can create simple functions using embedding_
services, but we should rely on existing features. There are functions like sema
ntic_search_documents and store_evidence_vectors, yet no generic chunk function
by URL. I think the easiest way might be to use VectorDocument content_embedding
 for the previews, but I notice the method to create a VectorDocument isn’t avai
lable. I’m contemplating alternatives that involve PrivateChunk or evidence stor
age methods.**Implementing vector repo features**

It seems like a reasonable approach to use our vector repository for the upsert
function by calling embedding_service.embed_batch on texts. Then, I can use vect
or_storage.get_vector_storage().store_evidence_vectors with the conversation_id
and set the URL as the source_id and the snippet as the text. We can then search
 for similar evidence using find_similar_evidence. Additionally, I want to ensur
e we write to the autonomy_semantic_notes table with idempotency in mind—perhaps
 checking for identical notes with the same run_id to prevent duplicates. I’ll a
lso update the episodic_repo for event handling.**Updating the executor process*
*

I want to ensure the Executor consults the vector repository first during the re
search step. We previously modified the executor to choose tools, but now I’ll u
pdate it to search using vector_repo.search first. If results are low, it’ll swi
tch to web_search and upsert. I need to make sure observation.sources are always
 populated. I’ll also add a test to ensure that upserting two chunks successfull
y returns them. To avoid real network calls, I’ll set up fallback options for em
bedding in case the embedding service isn’t available or SKIP_AI_CALLS is true.*
*Adjusting embedding strategy**

I need to check if settings.skip_ai_calls is true. If it is, I could create pseu
do embeddings using a deterministic hash function to generate values in 1536 dim
ensions, mostly set to zero. Alternatively, I could use zeros for all dimensions
, which wouldn’t distinguish vectors when using cosine_distance, but I just need
 retrieval. The find_similar_evidence function expects to work with the evidence
_embedding vector type, so I have to ensure we store data correctly, possibly as
 numeric arrays in PostgreSQL if I go that route.**Refining the 'expand' and exe
cutor process**

For the 'expand' function, I didn’t define edges, but it will be called as a rou
te from reflect. After the expand returns state, the compiled graph might end up
 at a dead end, which might be okay for now. I need to update executor.py to sea
rch the vector_repo first before executing research. If the results are below a
certain threshold, I’ll call web_search and upsert, ensuring Observation.sources
 are properly set. I also want to implement a test for upserting two chunks and
confirming their retrieval with scores in vector_repo. I'll set the run_id and c
heck for non-empty results. Let's make vector_repo functions asynchronous while
keeping some synchronous to match the existing style.

Hmm, I see I've made a mistake with my syntax by using "run_id: string := None,"
 which isn't valid. I need to correct that line before moving forward. It’s a re
minder to double-check the syntax I’m using to ensure everything works smoothly.
 I’ll focus on fixing this mistake to keep things on track. This will help avoid
 any potential issues later on!

codex
I read prompt8.md and implemented vector memory with real adapters and safe fall
backs, then connected Researcher and Executor to use it. Also added small conven
ience methods and a focused test.

**Episodic Memory**
- backend/src/autonomy_v2/memory/episodic_repo.py
  - Added `write_event(run_id, role, content)` and `list_events(run_id)` as wrap
pers around existing append/list logic.

- backend/src/autonomy_v2/memory/semantic_repo.py
  - Added DB-backed `distill(run_id, notes)` and `list(run_id)` storing to `auto
- backend/src/autonomy_v2/memory/vector_repo.py
  - New `VectorRepo(run_id)` with:
    - `upsert_chunks(chunks:[{text,url}])`:
      - Fallback (e.g., `skip_ai_calls` true or provider unavailable): store as
rows in `autonomy_semantic_notes` in a simple “url|||text” format (idempotent).
    - `search(query, k=5)`:
      - Primary path: embed query and call `vector_storage.find_similar_evidence
(..., conversation_id=run_id)`.
      - Fallback: naive substring search over `autonomy_semantic_notes` rows, re
turning [{text,url,score}] sorted by score.

This approach respects existing embedding/pgvector services when available, and
gracefully avoids network calls during dev/test.

**Agents**
- backend/src/autonomy_v2/agents/researcher.py
  - On expand/initial research: calls `tools/web_search.search(...)`, upserts re
sults into `VectorRepo`, and sets observation with sources (URLs). Routes back t
o “act”.
- backend/src/autonomy_v2/agents/executor.py
  - For “research” steps:
    - Tries `VectorRepo.search` first; if empty, does `web_search` and upserts v
ia `VectorRepo`.
    - Always sets `Observation.sources` and marks step done.
  - For other step kinds, keeps simple tool execution but ensures `sources` exis
ts.

**Test**
- backend/src/tests/test_autonomy_v2_vector.py
  - Upserts two chunks and confirms a search returns them with URLs and scores.

How to run this focused test
- pytest -q backend/src/tests/test_autonomy_v2_vector.py

Notes
- When `OPENAI_API_KEY` is missing or `ENABLE_AUTONOMY_V2` uses skip flags, the
vector repo falls back to `autonomy_semantic_notes` with a naive search, ensurin
g tests remain runnable offline.
- When vector tables from `vector_storage.py` are present and configured, the re
po uses the real embedding + pgvector path automatically.

**Implementing YAML and tool execution**

I'm focusing on implementing YAML files and updating the harness to load and exe
cute tasks. We already have some functions in evaluation/harness.py, like run_on
ce and demo_turnitin_pause_resume. Now, we need to add a runner to read differen
t YAML tasks and execute them. I’m also considering simulating a tool that exper
iences 429 errors twice before succeeding. This could be done by monkeypatching
the LLM or tool registry to manage the backoff behavior for the external tool ca
lls.**Planning rate limit handling**

To address rate limiting, I’m considering setting a plan step kind called 'tool'
 and using our registry to map it. Currently, the registry maps 'research' to we
b_search and 'write' to echo, but there's no existing mapping for 'tool.' I coul
d add this mapping to include a registered 'flaky' tool as a temporary option. H
owever, since registry mappings are set at import, I’d need to call register_too
l at runtime. This way, the planner can create steps, and we can build a workaro
und for the rate_limit tasks.**Designing the rate limit solution**

To avoid changing the code extensively, I think I could map 'tool' to 'echo' as
a default option. However, it’s possible to temporarily set _KIND_MAP['tool'] to
 'flaky' by registering it with kinds=['tool']. I should implement a flaky tool
function that tracks an internal counter and simulates a 429 error for the first
 several calls. Since the executor calls tools synchronously and there's no retr
y mechanism, maybe monkeypatching llm.complete to simulate errors could also wor
k for our rate limit requirements.**Planning the execution graph**

I need to run a graph that requires invoking the planner, which uses json_call t
hat allows for retries. Great! For the second task, called out_of_scope_research
, I should ensure the local memory is cleared; by default, it is empty. The rese
archer and executor will perform a web_search using a wrapper that calls google_
web_search, which will return mock results to assert against. For the third task
, turnitin_cycle, the graph should pause to call the API webhook. Our harness ca
n either interact with the FastAPI app or update the database directly.**Managin
g webhook and task execution**

I see that the system expects to be awaited and uses _get_db_manager to enqueue
a resume job. However, our worker isn’t running, and the acceptance criteria say
 to ensure resume and END. Since our webhook now enqueues the job rather than re
the webhook function and read parameters from YAML files.

his adjustment slightly deviates from the original intention but still aligns wi
th ensuring resuming and ending correctly. I’ll also update the harness to call
the webhook function and read parameters from YAML files.

**Implementing change**

I'm deciding to focus on implementing the critic change first. It seems like the
 best place to start since it's a priority. I want to make sure that I thoroughl
y understand what changes are needed and how to best execute them. I'll take som
e time to outline the steps necessary to ensure this process goes smoothly. It's
 important that I approach this with care to avoid any complications later on.

codex
I implemented prompt9.md by adding three evaluation tasks, extending the harness
 to run them, and a Makefile target to execute the suite.

**Tasks**
- backend/src/autonomy_v2/evaluation/tasks/rate_limit_resilience.yaml
  - type: rate_limit_resilience
  - goal + planner_failures values to simulate 429s before success.
  - type: out_of_scope_research
  - goal + min_sources to assert ingestion and completion.
  - goal + target_similarity + observed_similarity to simulate webhook pass.
- backend/src/autonomy_v2/evaluation/harness.py
  - Loads YAML tasks and runs each:
    - Rate-limit resilience:
it reaches END), verifies `Observation.sources` >= min_sources and route END.
    - Turnitin cycle:
      - Runs to turnitin_pause, simulates webhook (calling `turnitin_report_webh
ook` or direct DB update), resumes run (route 'act'), verifies route END.
  - Adds run_all_tasks() and __main__ entry to execute all three tasks.
  - Keeps earlier smoke utilities.

**Agent Logic Improvement**
- backend/src/autonomy_v2/agents/critic.py
  - If Turnitin policy is on, checks the latest autonomy_turnitin_cycles row; if
 status=report_ready and observed_similarity <= target_similarity, routes END; o
therwise requests handoff.

**Memory Repos**
- backend/src/autonomy_v2/memory/episodic_repo.py
  - Adds write_event() and list_events() convenience wrappers.
- backend/src/autonomy_v2/memory/semantic_repo.py
  - Adds distill(run_id, notes) and list(run_id) writing to autonomy_semantic_no
tes with idempotency.

**Makefile**
- test-autonomy target to run all tasks:
  - make test-autonomy

Command to run
- make test-autonomy

Expected outcome
- Rate limit task passes after simulated 429 retries by planner.
- Out-of-scope task ingests web docs via web_search and ends; sources >= min_sou
rces.
- Turnitin task pauses, accepts webhook with observed_similarity, resumes, and e
nds due to similarity below target.

user
now, next is to implement the prompt in the updated @prompt10.md

thinking
I need to open prompt10.md to check what the user is asking. My focus is on impl
ementing changes based on the instructions given in that file. I'll make sure to
 keep any modifications additive and in line with the current style. Reading the
 file carefully will help ensure that I understand the requirements, so I can pr
oceed correctly. Let's see what's outlined there and how I can adjust accordingl
y!

I added minimal, read-only V2 run APIs and an SSE stream of episodic events, all
 additive and behind the existing V2 router.

**Endpoints**
- POST `/api/v2/runs`
  - Request: `{ journey: string, task_spec: object }` (e.g., `{ "journey":"write
", "task_spec": { "goal":"..." } }`)
  - Behavior: generates `run_id`, seeds a checkpoint via SQL checkpointer with b
udgets from config, logs an episodic “run_created”, and enqueues the job.
  - Response: `{ run_id, state }` where `state` is the initial GraphState snapsh
ot.
- GET `/api/v2/runs/{run_id}`
  - Returns the latest checkpoint snapshot: `{ run_id, task, route, plan, budget
_tokens, budget_seconds, last_observation, notes }`.
- GET `/api/v2/runs/{run_id}/events`
  - SSE stream of `autonomy_episodic_logs` for the run (simple text/event-stream
 with JSON payloads).
  - Internally polls the DB with `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`-free reads
and emits new events since last id; sends a “connected” event first.

**Files Updated**
- backend/src/api/autonomy_v2.py
  - Added imports and SSE support via `sse_starlette.EventSourceResponse`.
  - POST `/runs`: new request/response schemas; seeds checkpoint via `sql_checkp
ointer`; logs an episodic event; enqueues via `enqueue(...)`.
  - GET `/runs/{run_id}`: reads checkpoint and returns the minimal snapshot.
  - GET `/runs/{run_id}/events`: polls `autonomy_episodic_logs` and emits JSON e
vents.
  - Minor: kept Turnitin webhook; switched resume to queue enqueue in a prior st
ep.

**Helpers Already In Use**
- `sql_checkpointer.put/get` to seed and read checkpoints.
- `EpisodicRepo.write_event` to log “run_created”.
- `enqueue(...)` in `autonomy_v2/runtime/queue.py` to queue the run.

**Example usage (local)**
- Start a run
  - curl -sX POST http://localhost:8000/api/v2/runs -H 'Content-Type: applicatio
n/json' -d '{"journey":"write","task_spec":{"goal":"Write a short overview of LL
Ms"}}'
  - Response contains `run_id`
- Stream events in another terminal
  - curl -N http://localhost:8000/api/v2/runs/<RUN_ID>/events
- Read snapshot at any time
  - curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/v2/runs/<RUN_ID>

Notes
- Endpoints live under `/api/v2/*` because the main app mounts the V2 router wit
h prefix `/api` and router prefix `/v2`.
- SSE emits a lightweight JSON envelope per event; compatible with simple EventS
ource clients.
- No changes were made to v1 APIs or existing routes.
