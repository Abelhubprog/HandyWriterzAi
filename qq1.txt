1. Agent and Orchestration Core
 Audit and refactor all agent entrypoints: backend/src/agent/app.py, handywriterz_graph.py, base.py.

 Add docstrings and type hints for each exported function.

 Ensure every agent class has: receive_input, process, emit_output methods.

 Validate and document all nodes in backend/src/agent/nodes/.

 List all nodes and their roles (e.g. aggregator, memory_integrator_node, planner, fail_handler).

 For each: confirm signature, input/output contract, error handling.

 Swarm Orchestration

 Review and debug orchestration logic (orchestration/, swarm_coordinator.py).

 Create sequence diagrams for “prompt → swarm → output” for all main flows.

 Implement logging for every message handoff between agents.

2. Agent State & Memory (Crucial!)
 Review and update memory handling logic (memory_integrator_node.py, memory_writer.py, memory_retriever.py, memory_integrator.py, README_MEMORY.md).

 Standardize memory API (read, write, retrieve, clear).

 Add integration tests: agent output → write to memory → retrieve on next call.

 Build a minimal “memory demo agent” to prove round-trip persistence.

 If vector DB (pgvector) is used, ensure semantic memory queries work (test for leaks and silent failures).

 Document memory lifecycle: where it’s stored, when it’s loaded, when it’s cleared (per user/session/agent?).

3. Multi-Model and Provider Wiring
 Ensure model selection is working and dynamic.

 backend/src/models/ and config/model_config.yaml: audit all models and update to only SOTA models (e.g. Gemini 2.5 Pro, O3, Claude Opus, Kimi K2, etc.).

 Add endpoint (or admin panel) to change model assignments at runtime.

 Integration test: swap model for intent_analyzer, confirm output changes.

 Validate all provider classes in models/ for working API keys, error surfaces, and retry logic.

 Add coverage for streaming and non-streaming responses per model/provider.

4. Streaming & Real-Time Feedback
 Test all SSE endpoints (agent/sse.py, sse_unified.py, frontend chat hooks).

 Confirm client receives live tokens/messages as they’re generated.

 Inject artificial delays/errors to verify robust frontend updates/errors.

 On the frontend, ensure hooks (useChatStream, useStream, etc.) are robust against dropped/duplicate messages.

5. Full-stack Agentic User Journey
 Map every route a user takes: file upload → prompt entry → agentic swarm → streaming output → download/export.

 For each step, write an e2e test (backend/tests/e2e/test_full_flow.py).

 Confirm all agents are invoked, memory persists, output is streamed and stored.

 For each writing type, validate that the correct agents and models are called (test via dropdown selection, prompt, file context).

 Build smoke tests that:

 Upload a doc, run through all agents, get output, check for errors.

 Repeat for multimodal (audio/image) inputs.

6. Frontend <-> Backend Integration
 Refactor chat UI components to ensure unified, ChatGPT-like experience (see EnhancedChatView.tsx, MessageInputBar.tsx, ImprovedInputForm.tsx).

 Confirm chat messages, uploads, agent outputs, and streaming work end-to-end.

 Fix any detachment in dropdowns, uploaders, message display (as per your notes/screenshots).

 Integration test: send prompt, see streaming response, show agent steps/activities.

 Add loading/error states for slow/failed responses.

7. Admin/Debug/Diagnostics
 Expose agent status and orchestration logs in the admin dashboard (ModelConfigPanel, AgentOrchestrationDashboard).

 Implement health checks for:

 All model providers (returns valid, up/down, quota info).

 Memory and database connection.

 SSE endpoint.

 “Replay” failed agent runs with the same input (for debugging).

8. Testing, Monitoring, and Deployment
 Achieve >90% test coverage in backend agent logic and orchestration.

 Ensure all critical workflows are covered in Playwright E2E tests.

 Setup error monitoring (Sentry or similar) for backend exceptions and streaming failures.

 Test Docker and Railway deployment scripts (all .sh and Dockerfiles).

 Deploy to Railway staging, run all e2e tests.

 Validate logs, error handling, and service restarts.

 Prepare production configs for all required environment variables (cross-check with .env.example and docs).

9. Documentation & Hand-off
 For each major backend module, update markdown in backend/docs/ (especially agentic.md, flow.md, usersjourneys.md).

 Document every agent type, their flow, and example input/output.

 Add a “Debugging Agentic Failures” guide (common root causes, e.g., failed orchestration, memory not persisting, model errors).

CRITICAL: Showstoppers
If any of these fail, the agentic system won’t work:

Memory not persisting across agent steps or user sessions.

Model APIs returning errors/silent failures (quota, 4xx, 5xx).

Frontend not receiving streaming output or out-of-sync with backend.

Orchestration loop breaks after agent fail (no retries, no failover).

Database or Redis disconnects not gracefully handled.

Test each of these as its own dedicated “failure mode” scenario.

How to track progress?
Make every TODO its own ticket/task in your tracker.

Require a demo or test for every critical user journey (“from upload to agent swarm output in UI”).

No ticket closed until “works end-to-end, robust to errors, and recovers gracefully.”
